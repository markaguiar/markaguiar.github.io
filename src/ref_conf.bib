abstract = {Sovereign debt markets are plagued by a number of frictions; in particular, a limited commitment to repay, limited commitment to future fiscal policies (debt dilution), lack of state contingency, and vulnerability to self-fulfilling runs.  We use an analytical model to explore the role of maturity in mitigating or exacerbating the respective frictions.  We show that long-term debt with a variable (but capped) coupon combines many of the desirable properties of both short-term and long-term bonds.  We then turn to a quantitative model to explore the welfare benefits or costs of issuing floating rate bonds.},

title = {Emerging Market Fluctuations: The Role of Interest Rate and Productivity Shocks},
journal = {Tenth Annual Conference on the Central Bank of Chile: Current Account and External Financing},
year = {2006},
abstract = {In this paper we use a quantitative model to explore the potential frictions that distinguish emerging market business cycles from developed small open economies. Following Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) we allow total factor productivity (TFP) to have a stationary and an integrated component. We also allow for shocks to the consumption and investment Euler Equations that operate through the interest rate. These {	extquoteleft}{	extquoteleft}wedges{	extquoteright}{	extquoteright} represent changes in the intertemporal marginal rate of transformation, which may be due to changes in observed interest rates, unobserved borrowing constraints, or other financial frictions. We estimate the model using data from Mexico and Canada. We show that interest rate shocks orthogonal to domestic TFP fail to explain the behavior of emerging markets. We then allow for interest rates to respond to/co-vary with productivity shocks. We find that emerging market business cycles appear to be driven by large shocks to trend income combined with relatively small transitory shocks that co-vary with the interest rate.},
