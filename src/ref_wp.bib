title = {Tariff Wars and Net Foreign Assets},
year = {2025},
journal={Working Paper},
abstract = {   This note addresses whether and when a trade war that imposes balanced trade (or even zero trade) can be consistent with initial non-zero net foreign asset positions. Using a bilateral trade model, we exploit insights from the classic literature on the Transfer Problem to characterize when gross asset or liability positions and tariff policies generate an endogenous terms-of-trade effect that ensures the value of assets and liabilities balance. As long as gross positions denominated in different goods differ in sign, there exists a continuum of bilateral tariff policies that ensure balanced  trade and that satisfy the contractual financial obligations.  If the new terms-of-trade do not reverse the initial direction of trade, balanced trade is consistent with non-zero exports and imports. In general, high enough bilateral tariffs lead to an autarkic outcome where no trade occurs and the net foreign asset positions rebalance to zero. },

title = {Putting the 'Finance' into 'Public Finance': A Theory of Capital Gains Taxation},
year = {2024},
journal={Working Paper},
abstract = {Standard optimal capital tax theory abstracts from modeling asset prices, making it unsuitable for thinking about capital gains and wealth taxation. We study optimal redistributive taxation in an environment with asset price changes, adopting the modern finance view that asset prices fluctuate not only because of changing cash flows, but also due to other factors (``discount rates''). We show that the optimal tax base (i) generally differs from the case with constant asset prices, and (ii) depends on the sources of asset-price changes. Whenever asset prices fluctuate, and are not exclusively driven by cash flow changes, taxes must target realized trades and generally involve a combination of realization-based capital gains and dividend taxes. This result stands in contrast to the classic Haig-Simons comprehensive income tax concept, as well as recent proposals for wealth or accrual-based capital gains taxes.},

title = {Pareto Improving Fiscal and Monetary Policies: Samuelson in the New Keynesian Model},
year = {2023},
journal={Working Paper},
abstract = {This paper explores the positive and normative consequences of government bond issuances in a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents, focusing on how the stock of government bonds affects the cross-sectional allocation of resources in the spirit of Samuelson (1958).  We characterize the Pareto optimal levels of government bonds and the associated monetary policy adjustments that should accompany Pareto-improving bond issuances.   The paper introduces a simple phase diagram to analyze the global equilibrium dynamics of inflation, interest rates, and labor earnings in response to changes in the stock of government debt.   The framework also provides a tractable tool to explore  the use of fiscal policy to escape the Effective Lower Bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates and the resolution of the ``forward guidance puzzle.''  A common theme throughout is that following the monetary policy guidance from the standard Ricardian framework leads to excess fluctuations in income and inflation. },

title = {Crisis and Commitment: Inflation Credibility and the Vulnerability to Sovereign Debt Crises},
year = {2013},
journal={Working Paper},
abstract = {We propose a continuous time model of nominal debt and investigate the role of inflation credibility in the potential for self-fulfilling debt crises. Inflation is costly, but reduces the real value of outstanding debt without the full punishment of default. With high inflation credibility, which can be interpreted as joining a monetary union or issuing foreign currency debt, debt is effectively real. By contrast, with low inflation credibility, sovereign debt is nominal and in a debt crisis a government may opt to in- flate away a fraction of the debt burden rather than explicitly default. This flexibility potentially reduces the country’s exposure to self-fulfilling crises. On the other hand, the government lacks credibility not to inflate in the absence of crisis. This latter chan- nel raises the cost of debt in tranquil periods and makes default more attractive in the event of a crisis, increasing the country’s vulnerability. We characterize the interaction of these two forces. We show that there is an intermediate inflation credibility that minimizes the country’s exposure to rollover risk. Low inflation credibility brings the worst of both worlds—high inflation in tranquil periods and increased vulnerability to a crisis.},
