title = {Sovereign Debt Crises and Floating-Rate Bonds},
year = {2021},
journal={Working Paper},
abstract = {Sovereign debt markets are plagued by a number of frictions; in particular, a limited commitment to repay, limited commitment to future fiscal policies (debt dilution), lack of state contingency, and vulnerability to self-fulfilling runs.  We use an analytical model to explore the role of maturity in mitigating or exacerbating the respective frictions.  We show that long-term debt with a variable (but capped) coupon combines many of the desirable properties of both short-term and long-term bonds.  We then turn to a quantitative model to explore the welfare benefits or costs of issuing floating rate bonds.},

title = {Micro Risks and (Robust) Pareto Improving Policies},
year = {2022},
journal={Working Paper},
abstract = { We provide sufficient conditions for the feasibility of a Pareto-improving fiscal policy when the risk-free interest rate on government bonds is below the growth rate (r<g) or there is a markup between price and marginal cost.  We do so in the class of  incomplete markets models pioneered by Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari, but we allow for an arbitrary amount of ex ante heterogeneity in terms of preferences and income risk.  We consider both the case of dynamic inefficiency as well as the more plausible case of dynamic efficiency.  The key condition is that seigniorage revenue raised by government bonds exceeds the increase in the interest rate times the initial capital stock. The Pareto improving fiscal policies weakly expand every agent's budget set at every point in time.  The policies improve risk sharing and potentially guide the economy to a more efficient level of capital. We establish that debt and investment associated with Pareto-improving policies may be complements along the transition, rather than the traditional substitutes.},

title = {Who are the Hand-to-Mouth?},
year = {2020},
journal={Working Paper},
abstract = {Many households hold little wealth, especially liquid wealth. In precautionary sav- ings models, absent preference heterogeneity, these households should display not only higher marginal propensities to consume (MPC’s), but also lower average propensities to consume (APC’s) and higher future consumption growth. We see from the PSID that such “hand-to-mouth” households actually display higher APCs and no faster spending growth. They also adjust spending to a greater extent through the num- ber of categories consumed. Consistent with a role for preference heterogeneity, the panel data show that it is propensity to be hand-to-mouth, not current assets, that predicts high APC, low consumption growth, and other spending differences for the hand-to-mouth. To identify the role of preference heterogeneity, we consider the model of Kaplan and Violante (2014) with both liquid and illiquid assets, but allow hetero- geneity in preferences. To match the data, the vast majority of poor hand-to-mouth must be impatient and have high IES. The richer, but illiquid, hand-to-mouth are dis- proportionately high IES, though not impatient. Thus a high IES is a key determinant of assets for households typically viewed as hand-to-mouth. The model additionally shows that preferences play a prominent role in differences in MPC’s across consumers.},

@article {AAFG2013,
title = {Crisis and Commitment: Inflation Credibility and the Vulnerability to Sovereign Debt Crises},
year = {2013},
journal={Working Paper},
abstract = {We propose a continuous time model of nominal debt and investigate the role of inflation credibility in the potential for self-fulfilling debt crises. Inflation is costly, but reduces the real value of outstanding debt without the full punishment of default. With high inflation credibility, which can be interpreted as joining a monetary union or issuing foreign currency debt, debt is effectively real. By contrast, with low inflation credibility, sovereign debt is nominal and in a debt crisis a government may opt to in- flate away a fraction of the debt burden rather than explicitly default. This flexibility potentially reduces the country’s exposure to self-fulfilling crises. On the other hand, the government lacks credibility not to inflate in the absence of crisis. This latter chan- nel raises the cost of debt in tranquil periods and makes default more attractive in the event of a crisis, increasing the country’s vulnerability. We characterize the interaction of these two forces. We show that there is an intermediate inflation credibility that minimizes the country’s exposure to rollover risk. Low inflation credibility brings the worst of both worlds—high inflation in tranquil periods and increased vulnerability to a crisis.},
