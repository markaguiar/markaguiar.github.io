#### Abstract

Sovereign debt markets are plagued by a number of frictions; in particular, a limited commitment to repay, limited commitment to future fiscal policies (debt dilution), lack of state contingency, and vulnerability to self-fulfilling runs.  We use an analytical model to explore the role of maturity in mitigating or exacerbating the respective frictions.  We show that long-term debt with a variable (but capped) coupon combines many of the desirable properties of both short-term and long-term bonds.  We then turn to a quantitative model to explore the welfare benefits or costs of issuing floating rate bonds.
