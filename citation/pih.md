#### Abstract

The permanent income hypothesis (PIH) is a theory that links an individual’s consumption at any point in time to that individual’s total income earned over his or her lifetime. The hypothesis is based on two simple premises: (1) that individuals wish to equate their expected marginal utility of consumption across time and (2) that individuals are able to respond to income changes by saving and dis-saving. In this article we present the intuition and empirical implications of the PIH in several standard contexts.
